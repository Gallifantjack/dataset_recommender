## Note on demographic segmentation

On the `BinaryClassification.gin` we have an example of how to use this segmentation.
If you don't intend to use the filtering you can just put None in the respective field.
The number of samples used will be shown during training as logging info.

```
preprocess.filter_criteria = {
    'age': (30, 60),
    'sex': 'male',
    'region': None
}
```
