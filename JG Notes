## Note on `environment_full.yml`

This file represents a clean environment created by following the standard installation instructions, plus additional packages that were found necessary during testing. It was generated on an Ubuntu system.

If you encounter errors during installation or runtime:

1. Compare your environment with `environment_full.yml` to identify any discrepancies.
2. You can attempt to recreate this exact environment using:
   ```
   conda env create -f environment_full.yml
   ```

This may help resolve dependency issues.

Remember that while this environment is known to work, it may include system-specific packages. If you're on a different operating system, you might need to make adjustments.

## Note on Data

The data is stored in a GCS bucket. To mount the bucket, you need to run the following script:

```
bash data/setup.sh
```

You will need to login to Google Cloud Services to mount the bucket.
This will mount the bucket to the `data` directory.

Then when you are finished, you can unmount the bucket by running:

```
bash data/teardown.sh
```

This will unmount the bucket.
